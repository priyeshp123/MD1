create __init__.py under each folder container python source to build packages.

All python code which needs to be built into packages will be created under
src. Under this directory, create sub-directories for each component. Each 
sub-directory must have __init___.py.

Plan:

1. Create Git repository
2. Setup environment
3. setup.py
4. requirements.txt

5. Src folder and build package

Process:

1. Download SEC Filings : Download_SEC_Filings.ipynb

   SEC Website --> ../MD1/data/R1000/filings

2. Validate and copy filing to stage 1: extract_docs.ksh

   Extract document filingSummary.xml 

   ../MD1/data/R1000/filings --> ../MD1/data/R1000/extract

3. Extract reports : Stage1_extract_reports.ipynb  

   Create a mapping file from filingSummary.xml (filemap.csv) with following
   fields (separated by !):

   report file name, short desc, long desc, filetype

   filetype is one of: htm, xml

4. Extract reports : extract_reports.ksh

   ../MD1./data/R1000/filings --> ../MD1/data/R1000/reports

   Use pattern matches to find reports of interest (balance,cash,income)
   and place them in reports directory.

   files are of the form:

   bal_report.<type> cash_report.<type> inc_report.<type>

   where type is one of: htm, xml

5. Extract tables : Stage2_extract_tables.ipynb

   Loop through each ticker in ../R1000/reports and extract tables.
   Create a master data set - dictionary(ticker,yr, [inc,cash,bal])
   Save master data set as pickle file.

6. Standardise tables : Stage3_standardise_tables.ipynb

   Create mapping of fields of interest. 
   Extract line items of interest and create a standardised table for 
   each statement type (bal,inc,cash).
   Standardised headings.
   Resolve issues with reporting units (thousands, millions)
